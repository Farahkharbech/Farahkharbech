## About Me
I’m a Full-Stack Web and Mobile Developer experienced in building production-ready platforms, authentication systems, real-time video applications, and custom WordPress solutions.

I work with modern JavaScript and PHP ecosystems, including MERN, React Native, Node.js (Fastify, Express), Prisma, PostgreSQL, Docker, and advanced WordPress development. I also have hands-on experience deploying full applications on unmanaged VPS environments.

I currently work remotely with a UK-based company and collaborate with a multidisciplinary team, contributing to both technical leadership and system architecture.
